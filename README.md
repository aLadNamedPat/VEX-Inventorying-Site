# VEX Inventorying Site For Robot Teams
I built this VEX inventorying site for helping to organize VEX supplies for VEX teams that are run by school organization and require a large number of orders.

This site is mostly a prototype idea that I plan to reimplement in React when I can find the time (in time -- hopefully sometime soon!)

Need to scrape data from VEX store when inventory changes, so maybe a development of an API to do so would be helpful.
